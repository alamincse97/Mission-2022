            <h1>Know Our Global Community</h1>
            <p>Being a member of a global community means that there is power within the community to bring voices
                together to effect change. Talk to the gatekeepers who can lead you to more in-depth information. They
                are important to gain entry into a group. Enlist “inside members” of that group to introduce you, and to
                establish trust and compliance within the community. Learn the perspective on an issue from the other
                side. Most of all, be a good listener. After discussion, form a consensus on behalf of the group, and
                present a united voice to influence policy. This is the best way to be a member of a global community
                that can effect change in a positive way. </p>
